# Smart-Personal-Planner-with-Weather-Forecast
Outdoor activities scheduling often have problems where those planned activities will be affected or postponed if they encounter a bad weather on the happening day. The outcome of this project is a web-based scheduling application â€“ Smart Personal Planner that will solve this outdoor activity scheduling problem by integrating itself with weather forecast ability. Smart Personal Planner is designed and created by a final year student who is currently taking Computer Science Degree in First City University College.

Throughout this project, the history or evolution of scheduling tools is researched and the existing scheduling applications are being reviewed to know their pros and cons as well as to solve the problem the past works faced in the Smart Personal Planner. Other than the weather forecasting feature, a chatbot is being implemented into the application too in order to ease the users during their scheduling processes as they can use human language to make new schedules. Besides that, Smart Personal Planner provides visualization of the activities planned in the form of calendar view.
This report covers the works that is done during the whole project which includes the planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing as well as close-out phases and it provides several suggestions on the future works that can be done such as chatbot improvement, increase the number of weather forecasting factors considered and make mobile version of the application to close-up the documentation.
